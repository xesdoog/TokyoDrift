# TokyoDrift

Lua script for YimMenu that helps you go sideways in GTA Online. _SKRRT_

This is a much better way to drift cars than that retarded _dRiFt TUnE_ that R* came up with. 🤦‍♂️
It also has a few other fun features for car enthusiasts.

>[!NOTE]
> Every feature in this script works whether you're a driver or a passenger. You can sit in a friend's car and make it drift or give it NOS.
